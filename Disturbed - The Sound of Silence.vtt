Hello darkness, my old friend

00:27.880 --> 00:33.870 align:middle
I've come to talk with you again

00:33.870 --> 00:39.370 align:middle
Because a vision softly creeping

00:39.950 --> 00:44.880 align:middle
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

00:45.870 --> 00:53.930 align:middle
And the vision that was planted in my brain

00:54.500 --> 00:58.190 align:middle
Still remains

00:58.720 --> 01:05.570 align:middle
Within the sound of silence

01:05.950 --> 01:11.000 align:middle
In restless dreams, I walked alone

01:11.950 --> 01:17.320 align:middle
Narrow streets of cobblestone

01:17.840 --> 01:22.900 align:middle
'Neath the halo of a street lamp

01:23.320 --> 01:28.000 align:middle
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

01:29.390 --> 01:37.060 align:middle
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

01:37.730 --> 01:41.490 align:middle
That split the night

01:42.120 --> 01:48.670 align:middle
And touched the sound of silence

01:49.190 --> 01:52.230 align:middle
And in the naked light, I saw

01:54.850 --> 01:38.000 align:middle
Ten thousand people, maybe more

02:00.820 --> 02:05.600 align:middle
People talking without speaking

02:06.500 --> 02:10.500 align:middle
People hearing without listening

02:10.740 --> 02:19.400 align:middle
People writing songs that voices never shared

02:20.350 --> 02:23.300 align:middle
And no one dared

02:24.470 --> 02:31.250 align:middle
Disturb the sound of silence

02:31.750 --> 02:36.700 align:middle
"Fools" said I, "You do not know

02:37.310 --> 02:42.500 align:middle
Silence like a cancer grows

02:43.160 --> 02:48.150 align:middle
Hear my words that I might teach you

02:48.550 --> 02:53.340 align:middle
Take my arms that I might reach you"

02:54.130 --> 03:01.420 align:middle
But my words, like silent raindrops fell

03:04.420 --> 03:11.790 align:middle
And echoed in the wells of silence

03:12.490 --> 03:17.450 align:middle
And the people bowed and prayed

03:18.000 --> 03:23.340 align:middle
To the neon god they made

03:23.550 --> 03:28.560 align:middle
And the sign flashed out its warning

03:28.940 --> 03:33.880 align:middle
In the words that it was forming

03:34.780 --> 03:43.540 align:middle
Then the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

03:44.130 --> 03:47.130 align:middle
In tenement halls"

03:47.320 --> 04:03.185 align:middle
And whispered in the sound of silence
